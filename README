You use the .bat file to lanch it wit.
First time setup will ask you to insert your Steam install folder manually.
It will also ask you for your SFM/game folder. (For those who have Portal SFM, choose SFM/game2)

After inserting all the information, the program will close. Is late and don't wanna bother fixing it right now, aaaaaa.
Re-open the program using the .bat file and it /should/ work.

If you change the install location of SFM or Steam, delete the "Paths.txt" file (which will only be there after setup)

Planned feutures: (Who knows when I will bother doing them)
-Auto detection for default-installed Steam and SFM.
-Auto-restart after first-time setup.
-Maybe an actual UI.

Am not really touching this much anymore.
Did so to just to add "open SFM game folder" option.
Have started making things, adding things, modifying things, etc, so, is useful.
And this should be the last update I will do to this.
